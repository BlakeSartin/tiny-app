TinyApp Instructions!

Register/Login:
Users must be logged in to create , view , and edit links.

Click Register on the top right, and put in your email and password.

Create New Links:
Create a New Short Link in My URLs page, or Create New URL on navigation bar.

Then simply enter the long URL you want to shorten.

Edit or Delete Short Links:
Freely delete and edit your own personal links on the home page!

Edited links will be the same short URL, but redirect to an updated long URL.

Use Your Short Link:
The path to use any short link is /u/:shortLink. This will redirect you to the long URL.

You can also reach this by clicking edit on a link, and using the link corresponding to the short URL.
